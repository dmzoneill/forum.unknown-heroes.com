// username: Your Account username (Not your character name)
// password: Your Account password
//           Please use the xxxxxx.php?encode=password to get the encoded version
//           of your password. You can also use your password in plain text and set
//           the "encoded" parameter to 'no'. Although base64 is far from being secure,
//           it is still better than plain text.
// encoded:  If you use the encode password function, this should be to yes.
// charname: Your Character name
// charid:   Your Character id (find it by going to your character account - see in url).
// filepath: Folder where you want to save the xml file. As this folder must exists and be writable (777), it should not
//           be http viewable. There is no unsecure code (that I'm aware of) in these files so there is no
//           worries to have about having this folder writable as long as no access is possible via a browser.
//           Note that if you have other scripts, you should check them to make sure they are secure.
//           Note also that a temporary cookie will be saved in that folder, another good reason to make it
//           unbrowsable.
//           Example : /home/yoursite/temp/eve/
//           Browsable: /home/yoursite/www/  <----- If root folder of your site where you put everything than BAD !!!
