// PHPBB Admin ToolKit v2.1b auto-generated config file.
//
// You may change the passwords in this file.

// Note: The passwords in this file are hashed for security.
// If you need to change your passwords, you can either use the MD5 Generator included
// near the bottom of the toolkit index.
// Or you can simply delete this toolkit_config.php file and run toolkit.php
// to recreate this file with the new passwords.
//
// NOTE: For security, the passwords for this toolkit have been DOUBLE hashed!
// Meaning, the password was hashed once using the md5() function, then the hash
// was hashed again using the md5() function. The code equivalent is: $pass = md5( md5( 'password' ) );
// Because the password is double hashed, it should be almost completely uncrackable as
// a brute force/dictionary attack would have to first crack a 32 character password, THEN
// crack the result yielding the original password.
// This way, even if someone got your toolkit.config.php file it would in theory
// take the most powerful home computer over 10 years to break.
